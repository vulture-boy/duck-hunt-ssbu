          <p>
          This page details changes to Duck Hunt over Super Smash Bros Ultimate's update history.
          This document redacts information that does not directly affect Duck Hunt or their gameplay environment since universal documents already exist. Unknown 'gameplay fixes' are also not included.
          Information has been pulled from <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)">SSBWiki</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Update-History-1549104.html" target="_blank">Nintendo's Official Update History</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
                (Document is a WIP; additional updates will be listed in the future)

            <li><a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/4.0.0_changelog#Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">
                4.0.0 - 31 Jul 2019</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - The combo counter in Training mode no longer has extra frames of leniency after the opponent's hitstun ends, increasing its accuracy.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - The Final Smash Meter now resets if the Final Smash is not used within 20 seconds after it is obtained outside of Spirits mode.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL/GLITCH - The spring activated Z-axis glitch has been fixed.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL/GLITCH - Players can no longer take damage during a Stamina Sudden Death countdown preventing characters to disappear from the stage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/3.1.0_changelog#Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">
                3.1.0 - 31 May 2019</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>UP AIR - Up aerial's first hit connects more reliably into the second (angle: 80&#176 -> 95&#176; knockback: 25 fixed/80 scaling -> 50/100).</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - Increased the minimum amount of time between wall jumps made in the same direction (130 frames -> 180).</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwa562kwhOk" target="_blank">Held item attacks have been removed.</a></li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL/GLITCH - Fixed an issue where characters appeared on screen in a way that caused them to take damage before the countdown ends.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL/GLITCH - Fixed an issue that caused an already-defeated character to reappear in a non-interactable state after getting blast KOed on screen with Death's Scythe and using a specific final smash at the exact location of their KO.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/3.0.0_changelog#Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">
                3.0.0 - 18 Apr 2019</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEUTRAL SPECIAL - Trick Shot deals less shield damage (0 -> -0.9/-1/-5 (reticle/impact/explosion).</li>
                    <li>SIDE SPECIAL - Clay Shooting deals less shield damage (0 -> -1 (clay impact), -0.9 (reticle), -1.3/-1.5 (clay break, hits 1-2/3)).</li>
                    <li>DOWN SPECIAL - The shots from Wild Gunman will no longer sometimes go through opponents.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - Perfect shields will no longer activate multiple times when the shield button is released once. This reduces its downtime, but makes multihit attacks harder to perfect shield, as each hit needs to be manually perfect shielded.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - In Training Mode, perfect shielding against a projectile grants 3 more frames of advantage. This has been properly applied to normal gameplay in 9.0.0.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - The value for "dodges refresh one level after X time of the last-used dodge's interruptibility" is now 1 second (from 0.5 seconds), so dodging can only be done once a second without penalty rather than twice.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>SIDE SPECIAL -  Clay Shooting has more endlag (FAF 61 -> 64).</li>
                    <li>SIDE SPECIAL -  Clay Shooting causes less hitlag (1x -> 0.5x/0.2x (hit 1/2-3)).</li>
                    <li>GLITCH - Fixed a game crash where Wild Gunman and the Mii Swordfighter's special moves were used at the same time.</li>
                    <li>GLITCH - Corrupt save data occurs if Duck Hunt plays Century Smash.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>UNIVERSAL - It is no longer possible to z-drop items out of hitstun.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - The x0.85 shorthop aerial damage multiplier when doing shorthop -> land -> fullhop -> aerial has been removed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_updates_(SSBU)/1.1.0_changelog" target="_blank">
                1.1.0 - 07 Dec 2018</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL - The AI for various characters has been adjusted.</li>
                    <li>UNIVERSAL/GLITCH - Fixed a glitch causing throws in Training Mode to gradually reduce knockback taken by the victim if the Fixed Damage option was turned on, even to the point of them taking no knockback.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1.0.0 - 07 Dec 2018
