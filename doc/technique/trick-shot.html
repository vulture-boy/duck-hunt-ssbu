          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Trick Shot is Duck Hunt's Neutral Special that spawns and manipulates their infamous Can. The action of spawning the projectile lasts 16 frames of a total 39 frames of endlag.
            <br>The Can is active on frame 1 of the move, meaning the spawn can be interrupted by an opponent's attack resulting in an explosion.
            <br>Opponents caught in the explosion will be sent at a relatively 45 degree upward angle facing in the direction they are from the can.
            <br>After the projectile spawning period is complete, the Can can be 'pinged' every 12 frames up to a maximum of 9 times.
            <br>After receiving 9 pings, a certain amount [?%] of damage or after a certain amount [?] of time, the can will enter an 'Overheat' state that increases its damage, knockback and makes it unaffected by attacks until it self destructs after approximately 2.5 seconds. 
            <br>Pinging the Can results in a 'reticle' appearing over the Can the same frame it is pinged that also causes damage to the opponent with knockback in the direction that Duck Hunt is facing.
            <br>The Can will always move in the direction that the character who last hit or created it was facing.

          <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use Can as a connective element to extend or create combo chains. For example, you could hit the opponent with an aerial into the can and catch them at the position they are sent, or throw them into the can as a potential KO technique.</li>
            <li>Hitting the can with BAir will make the can ping towards you.</li>
            <li>Hitting the can with vertically aligned moves such as DAir and UAir will generally reverse the direction it pings.</li>
            <li>As opponents are not always aware of the direction that the can will move when pinged, you can cover space adjacent to the can if you expect them to airdodge to avoid the Can's movement.</li>
            <li>You can use the Can as a combo breaker as it creates great separation between the opponent and the user at frame 1 upon contact, assuming the opponent is in the final spawn position at the time of contact.</li>
            <li>You can also use the explosion of the can on you and your opponent to lead to a followup attack. This is called a Canicide Combo (and isn't usually true but is often unexpected). <a href="/duck-hunt-ssbu/doc/technique/canicide.html" target="_blank">[read more]</a></li>
            <li>When the can spwaning is interrupted, it becomes full scale at the position it would be if the animation completed. If the position is occupied by a solid (such as Steve's blocks or a slope), it will move itself to a best-fit position.</li>
            <li>Shield Can is a popular technique of setting the can adjacent to your shield, such that it can be detonated when the opponent attempts to hit you.</li>
            <li>If a projectile hits the Can, the can will ping in the direction the character was facing when the projectile was created For example, Link's boomerang will make the can face the direction it was initially thrown, even if it's returning to sender.</li>
            <li>Knockback can be 'stored' in the can if it is pinged at the same time as it is hit with an attack. This will cause the next attack to send the can at the knockback that was stored in it. <a href="/duck-hunt-ssbu/doc/technique/knockback-storage.html" target="_blank">[read more]</a></li>
            <li>Anchor Can: If a Can is hit with a projectile, it will not move again if hit with a projectile until it is pinged or hit with another attack.</li>
            <li>Ceiling Can: If outside the ceiling bounds, the location hint showing Duck Hunt's position will not show the rendering of the Can. While it will still play audio, you can use the off-screen position to obscure its travel route. <a href="https://x.com/VVhiteHusky/status/1885814219146182829?mx=2" target="_blank">[Demo]</a></li>
            <li>If a Can comes into contact with a stationary Can (via opponent Duck Hunt or Kirby), it will 'bounce' off it.</li>
            <li>When grounded, the Can will only show its bullet holes if it will ping the Can towards the right. This is because the Can will set its orientation to its origin on the ground, rotated 180 degrees in the Y axis depending on the direction it is facing.</li>
            <li>The Can can be reflected while airborne. If the Can is grounded, reflectors will disable pinging of the can and cause it to detonate the next time it is hit with an attack.</li>
            <li>The Can can explode on Duck Hunt while airborne and be used as a means of resetting their recovery; this is called a Canicide Recovery. Because the Can requires a particular number of pings and must explode on Duck Hunt to work, this is considered a niche and technically challenging technique. <a href="/duck-hunt-ssbu/doc/technique/canicide.html" target="_blank">[read more]</a></li>
            <li>The Can's explosion is Fire element and can be absorbed.</li>
            <li>The reticles that ping the can are coded similarly to the ones used in Duck Hunt's smash attacks, which has historically caused mostly patched exploits.</li>
