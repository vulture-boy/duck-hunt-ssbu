          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            King Dedede is a heavyweight whose slow options and deflectable projectile make him struggle to enter Duck Hunt's zoning, but reaps significant reward with close-up engagements and pressure and a threatening ledge advantage state.<br>
            His protective and deflective options can be neutralized with Gunman's projectile disrupting his Suck and Gordo and, up close, spitting out a Can on Duck Hunt's shield.<br>
            King Dedede's Nair makes for effective and fast hitbox coverage around the ground and his hammer's disjoint occasionally is useful for knocking away Can and extending his reach.<br>
            King Dedede is also very vulnerable to anti-airing provided that his F7 nair, jump counts and hammer range are respected.

          <h2>Temp Notes</h2>
          <p>
            <i>I've added some temp notes sections to get content on pages sooner. These have not been reviewed thoroughly. Sorry about that!</i><br>
            <ul>
              <li>A major priority for King Dedede is to get in on Duck Hunt as at midrange and beyond, Duck Hunt's projectiles make for great initiation and chaining tools.</li>
              <li>SHFF Nair is effective for Dedede as a means to cover horizontal distance at midrange, and his Fair disjointedly covers more range at the cost of additional hit lag (but if it's expected to connect, it's likely worth it).</li>
              <li>Can and Clay Pigeon can be sucked and chucked. We particularly don't want the latter to be sent back to us as it can create dangerous disadvantage states.</li>
              <li>If Dedede sucks, spawning Can and immediately shielding at close range will blow up Dedede with the benefit of the added multiplier.</li>
              <li>Gunman is relatively safe at midrange as Dedede cannot bypass it without risky maneuvers like DTilt or tilts/jab. Use with movement to start engagements and plan for combos e.g. with plat-Can.</li>
              <li>Both characters have relatively strong advantage states against eachother.</li>
              <li>UAir is great for juggling, but watch out for Nair in the air, which is F7.</li>
              <li>If shielding Dedede's jab, when DHD is only being hit by the stub outside the barrel of Dedede's hammer, releasing shield can result into a parry (or leave DHD outside of Jab's range). You can use this opportunity to punish with a CP. <a href="https://youtu.be/5S3_aUfC5fI?feature=shared&t=198" target="_blank">[demo by embo_z]</a></li>
              <li>If Dedede air camps, wait for him to land. He has four (4) midair jumps.</li>
              <li>Beware ledgeslip FAir when recovering to ledge.</li>
              <li>Ideally you want to play from about half a stage away from Dedede.</li>

              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3_aUfC5fI" target="_blank">embo_z (Duck Hunt) vs Pengu-win (King Dedede) - Feb 4th, 2025</a></li>
              <ul><li>Embo_z demonstrates strong control over space, spacing, and awareness of Dedede's punishable states. Pengu-win plays to get in quickly for Nairs, grabs, and high impact swings while embo_z initiates from midrange into multiple consecutive hits, punishing Dedede's Suck with can into shield and openings (e.g. from Jab) into long CP chains. Can parry setups on can at the start of stocks help keep the can positioned on stage. Pengu-win gets some chains off Nairs and uses Suck midair and aerials off ledge to keep can and ledge pressure off.</li></ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_-g1EbKTLI" target="_blank">Katamari [かたまり] (Duck Hunt) vs Garuku [ガルク] (King Dedede) - Mar 12th, 2023</a></li>
              <ul><li>Katamari's VOD with Garuku demonstrates more standard gameplay VS Dedede; Katamari controls space with typical Duck Hunt techniques and Garuku reveals Dedede's ability to challenge them and more standard play for a heavyweight challenging a control zoner. Katamari uses CP more liberally than embo, demonstrating its use as a shield pressure tool as well as Dedede's ability to challenge bad tosses. Garuku demonstrates some of Dedede's more common ledgetrap techniques including Jet Hammer and sweeping hammer aerials. Garuku succeeds in getting in with the aid of advancing shield and capitalizing on Katamari's spacing when Duck Hunt attempts to make unsafe plays at about a quarter stage's distance. Katamari's use of Gunman as a backup shield for a grounded can helps avoid reversal situations, though arguably less effective than embo's strategy of shielding expected can Sucks.</li></ul>
